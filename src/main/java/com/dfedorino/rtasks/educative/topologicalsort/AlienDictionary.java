    /**
     * There is a dictionary containing words from an alien language for which we donâ€™t know the ordering of the
     * letters. Write a method to find the correct order of the letters in the alien language. It is given that the
     * input is a valid dictionary and there exists an ordering among its letters.
     * <p>
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: Words: ["ba", "bc", "ac", "cab"]
     * Output: bac
     * Explanation: Given that the words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of the alien language, so
     * from the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:
     * <p>
     *
     * 1. From "ba" and "bc", we can conclude that 'a' comes before 'c'.
     * 2. From "bc" and "ac", we can conclude that 'b' comes before 'a'
     * <p>
     *
     * From the above two points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "bac"
     * <p>
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: Words: ["cab", "aaa", "aab"]
     * Output: cab
     * Explanation: From the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:
     * <p>
     *
     * 1. From "cab" and "aaa", we can conclude that 'c' comes before 'a'.
     * 2. From "aaa" and "aab", we can conclude that 'a' comes before 'b'
     * <p>
     *
     * From the above two points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "cab"
     * <p>
     *
     * Example 3:
     * Input: Words: ["ywx", "wz", "xww", "xz", "zyy", "zwz"]
     * Output: ywxz
     * Explanation: From the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:
     * <p>
     *
     * 1. From "ywx" and "wz", we can conclude that 'y' comes before 'w'.
     * 2. From "wz" and "xww", we can conclude that 'w' comes before 'x'.
     * 3. From "xww" and "xz", we can conclude that 'w' comes before 'z'
     * 4. From "xz" and "zyy", we can conclude that 'x' comes before 'z'
     * 5. From "zyy" and "zwz", we can conclude that 'y' comes before 'w'
     * <p>
     *
     * From the above five points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "ywxz"
